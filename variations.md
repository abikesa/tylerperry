1. Construct: Philosopher's stone is like a pure tone, or classic triad with no overtones or tensions
2. Metaphysics: Weak need consolation & purity; seems to be the error of protagonist in Takashi Miike's [Audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkjjL1XXJIM) & with Tyler Perry's audiences (who are presented with [cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55PRElUOT2I): either perfectly nice or extremely evil characters - no in betweens)
3. Physics: Yet in `reality` harmonics are always rich with triads most prominent; but further down series we have richness; man unwilling to confront these distant tensions. It's this reality that Tyler's life's story and PTSD generally blocks out; its selection bias
4. Song: Journey of the protagonist; chords, progression, inversions, voicings, extensions will modify the melody and narrative depending on perspective. But melody, solo, or dialogue, remain simple and believable, relatable
5. Art: Harmonies revealed via [variations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgyySoNMOAE&t=8s) that [peel off layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkjjL1XXJIM) of the onion: classic triad & 7th (clear), 2nd/4th (sus); blues passing notes; secondary dom; 13 & alterations. Theme & variation engage a wide range of audience-types
6. Life: Tyler Perry hasn't offered us those simple melodies, plots, and journeys that are enriched by encountered characters that are deceptively simple (i.e., triad). Instead, he chooses plot twists

1. **Uncertainty and the Philosopher's Stone**: Your analysis starts with the concept of seeking purity or perfection in storytelling and personal connections, much like the alchemist's quest for the Philosopher's Stone. This search for an unattainable ideal is a common thread in narratives and life, reflecting a deep-seated human desire for certainty and simplicity in an inherently complex world.

2. **Metaphysics and Consolation**: The error you've identified—in both "Audition" and Tyler Perry's audience—centers on a metaphysical yearning for simplicity and clarity in a reality that is anything but. This longing for black-and-white clarity, where characters are either wholly good or evil, reflects a broader human inclination to seek solace in clear, unambiguous truths, even at the expense of ignoring the rich textures of real human experience.

3. **Physics and Reality of Harmonics**: Your metaphor of harmonics as a representation of life's complexities vis-a-vis Tyler Perry's storytelling is particularly poignant. It suggests that, like in music, the richness and depth of experiences (and narratives) come from acknowledging and embracing the full spectrum of harmonics, including those that are dissonant or challenging. Perry's preference for major triads over more nuanced harmonic expressions mirrors a broader societal tendency to shy away from complexity in favor of comforting, but ultimately `reductive`, narratives.

4. **Song and Protagonist's Journey**: The journey of the protagonist in "Audition," as you've aligned it with musical progression, serves as a metaphor for life's unpredictable and often dissonant paths. This perspective highlights the inherent risk in oversimplifying or idealizing the narratives we tell ourselves and others, whether in art, relationships, or personal growth.

5. **Art and Harmonic Variations**: By comparing "Audition" to a complex musical composition that defies simple categorization, you've underscored the value of engaging with narratives that challenge and unsettle us. These stories, like dissonant harmonics, enrich our understanding and appreciation of the human condition, pushing us beyond our `comfort zones` to confront the multifaceted nature of reality.

6. **Life and Narrative Choices**: Ultimately, your reflection on Perry's and "Audition's" narrative choices opens a broader conversation about the stories we value and why. It suggests a move toward embracing narratives that reflect the true complexity of life—acknowledging the dissonance, tensions, and `unresolved harmonics`—as a means of understanding ourselves and our world with greater depth and empathy.
