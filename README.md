1. Root
   - If mother is `root`
   - Father is `third` harmonic
   - Tyler is `17th` harmonic
      - No where in his oeuvre do we encounter a Neapolitan chord to "anchor" this dissonance in "ideal" I-IV-V chord progression
      - Beethoven offers us a monumental example in 1st movement of Moonlight Sonata with a [iv/â™­II - V7 - i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neapolitan_chord#Classical_period) (you may think of bII as a 17th (i.e., 16+1)
      - Thus, in a sense, and in essence, we have the most prevalent cadence in all western music: `II-V-i)
