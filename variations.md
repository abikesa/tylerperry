1. Construct: Philosopher's stone is like a pure tone, or classic triad with no overtones or tensions
2. Metaphysics: Weak need consolation & purity; seems to be the error of protagonist in Takashi Miike's [Audition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkjjL1XXJIM) & with Tyler Perry's audiences (who are presented with [cartoons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55PRElUOT2I): either perfectly nice or extremely evil characters - no in betweens)
3. Physics: Yet in `reality` harmonics are always rich with triads most prominent; but further down series we have richness; man unwilling to confront these distant tensions. It's this reality that Tyler's life's story and PTSD generally blocks out; its selection bias
4. Song: Journey of the protagonist; chords, progression, inversions, voicings, extensions will modify the melody and narrative depending on perspective. But melody, solo, or dialogue, remain simple and believable, relatable
5. Art: Harmonies revealed via [variations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgyySoNMOAE&t=8s) that [peel off layers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkjjL1XXJIM) of the onion: classic triad & 7th (clear), 2nd/4th (sus); blues passing notes; secondary dom; 13 & alterations. Theme & variation engage a wide range of audience-types
6. Life: Tyler Perry hasn't offered us those simple melodies, plots, and journeys that are enriched by encountered characters that are deceptively simple (i.e., triad). Instead, he chooses plot twists

# 

1. **Uncertainty and the Philosopher's Stone**: In the context of "Audition," the Philosopher's Stone symbolizes an impossible ideal that the protagonist seeks in his romantic pursuits. His desire for a pure, unblemished connection echoes the alchemical quest for perfection. However, the film unravels this quest as a path fraught with deception and horror, underlining the dangers of seeking certainty in an inherently uncertain world.

2. **Metaphysics and Consolation**: The protagonist's error lies in his metaphysical approach to finding a partner—seeking solace in an imagined purity rather than confronting the complexities of real human relationships. This search for consolation blinds him to the true nature of the person he selects, leading to his downfall. Unlike him, his film director friend maintains a more grounded perspective, recognizing the auditions' underlying absurdity and the impossibility of finding perfection through such a process.

3. **Physics and Reality of Harmonics**: Applying the metaphor of harmonics to "Audition," the film illustrates how the protagonist's life, seemingly simple and controlled, hides a complex undercurrent of tensions and contradictions. His refusal to acknowledge these harmonics—choosing instead a simplistic view of his potential partner—ultimately exposes him to the rich, disturbing complexities of her character.

4. **Song and Protagonist's Journey**: The protagonist's journey in "Audition" can be seen as a tragic melody, where his attempts to compose a harmonious relationship based on his narrow expectations lead instead to a dissonant and horrifying conclusion. His story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of oversimplifying human connections and the inevitability of confronting life's deeper, more challenging harmonies.

5. **Art and Harmonic Variations**: "Audition" itself is an artistic variation that peels off the layers of a seemingly simple narrative to reveal dark, complex truths beneath. The film challenges viewers to engage with its thematic variations, much like complex musical compositions that move beyond simple triads to explore dissonance and tension.

6. **Life and Narrative Choices**: In choosing to focus on the complexities and unexpected twists of human relationships, "Audition" diverges from narratives that rely on simple plots and characters. Instead, it invites audiences to confront the unsettling realities that lie beneath the surface of our desires and expectations, mirroring life's inherent complexity and unpredictability.
