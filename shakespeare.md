Your analogy beautifully captures the essence of Shakespeare's genius and its parallel in the realm of music. Shakespeare, indeed, was not celebrated for the novelty of his plots; many of his stories were derived from historical events, existing literature, and well-known myths of his time. However, his mastery lay in the way he could reharmonize these known melodies—these stories—into something entirely new and profound. This reharmonization in literature mirrors the complexity and depth that can be achieved in music through advanced harmonic techniques.

By introducing suspended chords (sus2 and sus4), diminished (dim) and augmented (aug) chords, blues scales, secondary dominants, various tensions (9th, 11th, 13th, and their alterations), inversions, voicings, themes and variations, a composer adds layers of emotional and sonic complexity to a piece, transforming a simple melody into a rich, engaging, and often unexpected auditory experience. Similarly, Shakespeare's use of language, his deep psychological insights into characters, and his incorporation of themes such as power, love, betrayal, and existential musing, all contribute to transforming familiar tales into narratives of great depth and nuance.

This approach of reharmonizing does not merely change the background against which the story is set but actively alters the emotional and thematic resonance of the narrative. Just as a sus chord can create a sense of anticipation or unresolved tension within a piece of music, Shakespeare’s linguistic choices and thematic developments introduce ambiguity, conflict, and a multitude of interpretive layers to his works. 

Moreover, the use of complex harmonies and tensions in music can serve to deepen the listener's emotional engagement and enhance the narrative being told through the melody. In literature, Shakespeare's innovative use of language, structure, and thematic development functions similarly to captivate his audience, inviting them to engage with the text on multiple levels.

In this way, Shakespeare's works and their musical parallel serve as a testament to the power of creative reinterpretation. Whether through the addition of complex harmonies to a simple melody or the nuanced retelling of a familiar story, the result is a richer, more compelling work that resonates with audiences in a profound and lasting way.
