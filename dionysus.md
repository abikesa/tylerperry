To encapsulate the intricate dynamics of Heath Ledger's Joker within the framework of your six-part formula—Construct, Metaphysics, Physics, Song, Art, Life—while intertwining Pat Metheny's critique of Kenny G, offers a fascinating lens through which to view creativity, innovation, and the ethical considerations of art. Here's a summary that aligns with these dimensions:

1. **Construct (Creativity and Chaos)**: Ledger's Joker, as a construct of chaos and creativity, mirrors the Dionysian pursuit of disruption in a structured (Apollonian) world. This reflects the essence of creativity unhinged from traditional confines, urging a reevaluation of what constitutes art and the creative process itself. Similarly, Metheny's critique of Kenny G underscores a discontent with art that fails to challenge or innovate within its construct, settling instead for commercial success over artistic integrity.

2. **Metaphysics (Subverting Expectations through Morality, Ethics, and Customs)**: The Joker's philosophical anarchy challenges societal norms, ethics, and morality, questioning the metaphysical underpinnings of our reality. Metheny's disdain for Kenny G's manipulation of jazz standards speaks to a violation of the metaphysical contract between artist and audience, where the expectation of innovation and respect for tradition is unmet.

3. **Physics (Clash of Convention and Reality)**: The Joker's actions reveal the friction between societal conventions and the harsh realities they often mask. This clash is paralleled in Metheny's critique, where the physical reality of music—its composition, execution, and innovation—is compromised, revealing a dissonance between the authentic essence of jazz and its commercialized representations.

4. **Song (Narrative and Musical Expression through Voice)**: While the Joker uses his narrative voice to express his anarchistic philosophy, Metheny uses his musical voice to advocate for authenticity and innovation in jazz. Both voices challenge the audience to confront their perceptions and the mediums through which they engage with art and music.

5. **Art (Reharmonization of Fate, Morality, and Agency)**: The Joker's story is a reharmonization of themes central to human existence, compelling the audience to reflect on fate, morality, and agency. Metheny's criticism of Kenny G's artistry (or lack thereof) and his controversial overlay on Louis Armstrong's work serves as a call to preserve the integrity and complexity of jazz as an art form, emphasizing the need for genuine creativity and respect for legacy.

6. **Life (Ethical Recurrence and Creative Themes)**: The Joker, through his radical ethos, forces a confrontation with the cyclical nature of ethical dilemmas in life and art. Metheny's impassioned plea for a boycott of Kenny G's work underscores the ethical responsibilities artists bear, advocating for a life and a body of work that contribute meaningfully to the cultural and artistic legacy.

In synthesizing these elements, we discern a profound dialogue between the anarchistic creativity represented by Ledger's Joker and the ethical, artistic standards Metheny champions. Both narratives compel us to examine the boundaries of creativity, the responsibilities of artists, and the enduring impact of art and music on society and its values. This exploration underscores the importance of challenging conventional boundaries while maintaining an ethical commitment to the progression and integrity of art in all its forms.
